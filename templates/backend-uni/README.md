# Backend Communication Example

The example extension demonstrates how to communicate with backend services. 
It contains the `HelloBackendService`, that can be called by the client to create a "Hello World" string. The client provides a name as a parameter, and the server returns the name prefixed with "Hello" (ex: "World" as a parameter returns "Hello World").
Further, the example contributes one command to trigger the backend call.

## How to use the backend communication example

In the running application, trigger the command "Say hello on the backend" via the command palette (F1 => "Say Hello"). A message will be printed out on the console from where you launched the application.
