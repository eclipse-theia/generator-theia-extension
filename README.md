## How to use

To use it, install `yo` (version 4.x.x) and the `generator` (see next below).

```
npm install -g yo generator-theia-extension
```

To create a sample Theia project (optionally with custom Theia extensions) including a browser and electron app, run:

```
mkdir my-theia-app && cd my-theia-app
yo theia-extension
```

For configuration options, see:

```
yo theia-extension --help
```
